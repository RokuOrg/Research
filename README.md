# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) <a id="XSS"></a>  

- ## Introduction <a id="XSSIntroduction"> </a>  
    Cross-site scripting is a type of attack where the attacker injects malicious scripts into a website.  
    The attack is carried out by using a web application to send malicious scripts to a different user.  
    It XSS is one of the most common vulnerability  on the web taking up almost 40% of all cyberattacks in 2019.  
    XSS uses a vulnerability  in a web application where the web applisation doesn't validate or encode a user's input.  
    The user isn't able to distinguish as XSS script from a non-malicious script, because the origin of both   
    scripts are the same so the user has reason to assume that the script is malicious.  

- ## The Different Types of XSS Attacks<a id="XSSAttacks"></a>
    There are mainly 3 different types of XSS. Which are: 
    Reflected XSS, Where the vulnerability lies in the Http request sent.  
    Stored XSS, Where the vulnerability lies in the data being stored to the datbase.  
    DOM-Based XSS, Where the vulnerability lies in the client-side code.  

    ### **Reflected XSS**<a id="ReflectedXSS"> </a>
    Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent XSS) is the simplest variant of different XSS types.  
    The attack is carried out by inserting a malicious script into a HTTP Request ususaly in the form  
    of a URL. It only requires the user to click on the URL and the attack is carried out.

    | *(fig 1.)*|

    Example:  
    Let's say there is a website which shows the unfiltered URL query on the page.  
    ```
    URL: http://www.example.com/input?q=test  
    HTML: <p>Your input was test </p>  
    Output: Your input was test
    ```    

    Now let's inject a malicious script into this URL.  
    ```
    URL: http://www.example.com/input?q=test+%3Cscript%3EMalicious_Script()%3C/script%3E  
    HTML: <p>Your input was test<script>Malicious_Script()</script></p>  
    Output: Your input was test  
    ```  
    If the user clicks on the second link he will run the malicious script.  
    But the user will not notice any visible difference on the website.

    ### **Stored XSS <a id="StoredXSS"></a>**  
    Stored XSS (a.k.a. Persistent XSS or Second-Order XSS) is a type of attack where the script is stored in the application's database.   
    The malicious script can be submitted to the application via HTTP requests, for example: comments, usernames, user descriptions, etc.  
    The user doesn't even need to click the wrong link for the malicious script to get to them, as the script is requested by them expecting  
    it to be normal data.

    |:--:|
    | *(fig 2.)*|  

    Example:
    Let's say we have a website where you can create blog posts. And the blog post in open a stored XSS vulnerablilty.
    ```
    Input: This is a new blogpost
    Database: This is a new blogpost
    HTML: <p>This is a new blogpost</p>
    Output: This is a new blogpost
    ```  
    Now let's inject a malicious script to the input
    ```
    Input: This is a new blogpost <script>Malicious_Script()</script>
    Database: This is a new blogpost <script>Malicious_Script()</script>
    HTML: <p>This is a new blogpost <script>Malicious_Script()</script></p>
    Output: This is a new blogpost
    ```    
    Now again we see the same output from both input's but the second input has again a malicous script hidden in it's HTML.  
    For the user there is no visible difference between both input's.

# Object Storage Systems <a id="OSS"></a>  
 - ## Introduction to OSS
    An Object Storage System is a computer data storage system that treats data as objects, unlike filesystems that treat data as a file hierarchy,  
    or block storage that treats treats data as block within sectors and tracks.
